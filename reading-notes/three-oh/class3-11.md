- **Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**
  - |   **SQL**   |  **NoSQL**  |
    |:-----------:|:-----------:|
    | Table based | Document based, key-value pairs |
    | Predefined schema | Dynamic schema |
    | Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
    | Good for complex queries | Good for hierarchical data |
    | Structured Query Language | No Structure Query Language |
- **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
  - Complex queries
- **Give a real world example.**
  - MySQL
- **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
  - Large, hierarchical data
- **Give a real world example.**
  - MongoDB
- **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
  - NoSQL
- **Which type of database is best for scalability?**
  - "For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic."
- **What does SQL stand for?**
  - Structured Query Language
- **What is a relational database?**
  - Data is stored and accessed with pre-defined relationships between them.
- **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**
  - Related tables
- **What is a ‘schema’?**
  - The format of the stored data
- **What is a NoSQL database?**
  - Sores a large amount of data efficiently
- **How does it work?**
  - Collections of data, instead of tables, containing documents. No schemas.
- **What is inside of a Mongo database?**
  - Collections of data containing documents
- **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**
  - NoSQL, without schemas, more data or properties can be added.
- **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**
  - Duplicate data
