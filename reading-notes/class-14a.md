  - So many subtle calls to action here, I would even call some of the transformations here 'eastereggs' (try resizing the browser window)
  - Lynn Fisher has so much inspirational work. Her GitHub is worth a peek

  - Exquisite use of parallax scrolling here and very immersive experience with the music and art (definitely turn the sound on)
