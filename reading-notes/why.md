## 4. FILTER BY PURPOSE

When you’re feeling out of sorts about
what’s going on in your life, or if you’re
trying to decide if a new opportunity
fits your purpose, use these questions
to filter through to an answer.

- What core value does this fit with?
- What level of excitement do I have
about this?
- Will/does this distract from something
else that is very important to me?
- How might this play out in the future?
