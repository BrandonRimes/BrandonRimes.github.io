- Positioning a background image:
  - `background-repeat:` must be set to `no-repeat;`
  - `background-position:` can receive a pair of values
    - The first value is horizontal `left`, `center`, or `right`
    - The second is vertical, `top`, `center`, or `bottom`
    - Pixels and percentages can be used and are in relation to top left
    - If only on value is specified, the second defaults to `center`
